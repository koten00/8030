The goal of this project is to identify the author of Diplomacy of 'Great Citizen' through stylometry analysis. The signature of this article was S. C., but the real identity underlies this pseudonym is still a mystery. According to the research of traditional humanists, S. C. might be Hu Shih or Li Dazhao.
Naive Bayes and SVM are used to address this problem
